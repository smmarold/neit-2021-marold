                <p class="text">My name is <b>Stephen Marold</b>. I've had quite a few interesting experiences in my 34 years on earth. From actve duty in the Marine Corps, 
                    including a deployment, to driving from North Carolina to California and back to Rhode Island. 
                    Travelling, playing in bands, creating music, videos, games, movies and short stories. 
                    These are all just a few of the things I have done in my life. If I find something interesting, <strong>I try it</strong>. Sometimes it turns out to be an incredible
                    experience, others not so much. But, either way it always becomes a memory, a story, a lesson, and sometimes all three. 
                </p>
                <p class="text">On top of a full and exciting past, I have many goals for the future. After having tried many possible careers, 
                    I have decided to focus on software development as a career. I love coding, almost as much as I love playing music. I also plan on 
                    doing as mych travelling as I can. There are so many countries and places I would love to visit. Finally, a goal I haven't really 
                    shared with many people until now, is to one day get accepted to and graduate from Massachusettes Institute of Technology. It may be
                    a long shot, but that has never stopped me from trying in th past.
